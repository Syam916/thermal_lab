        <p class="h">Thermal engineering is a specialized discipline of mechanical engineering that deals with the movement of heat energy and transfer. Since the energy can be transformed between two mediums or transferred into other forms of energy, a thermal engineer must have knowledge of thermodynamics and the process to convert generated energy from thermal sources into chemical, mechanical, or electrical energy.</p>
        <p class="h">Thermal Laboratory provides lot of opportunity to the students to study different types of IC engine, boiler performance study and to do their innovative projects. The performance test, heat balance test, the retardation test and emission test can be carried in variety of IC engines like petrol/diesel fueled with single/double/multi cylinder engines with modern mechanical/electrical/hydraulic loading devices. </p>

        -->Such engines use a spark plug which is used for the ignition of the combustible fuel used in the engine<br>
        -->Most of the cars, bikes and trucks use a 4 stroke engines.<br>

        <P  class="t">
        -->A 2-stroke engine goes through 2 stages, or one complete revolution, to complete one power stroke. During the combustion cycle in an engine, the piston moves up and down within a cylinder where the piston travels.<br>
        -->At the end of the compression (previous) stroke, the spark plug fires and ignites the compressed air/fuel mixture. This ignition/explosion forces the piston back down the cylinder bore and rotates the crankshaft, propelling the vehicle forward.<br>
        -->The weight of the engine is less as compared to water-cooled engines. But due to the single cylinder, the engine provides only one power stroke in two complete revolutions of the shaft. hence power delivered to the crankshaft is in pulsating form, Which increases vibration in the engine.<br>

        <P  class="t">
            A spark-ignition engine (SI engine) is an internal combustion engine, generally a petrol engine, where the combustion process of the air-fuel mixture is ignited by a spark from a spark plug. This is in contrast to compression-ignition engines, typically diesel engines, where the heat generated from compression together with the injection of fuel is enough to initiate the combustion process, without needing any external spark.
