<h2 class="h2"><u>THEORY</u>:</h2>
<h3 class="t2">A machine which provides the gas at high pressure is called a compressor and work must be done upon the gas by external agency (prime mover). An air compressor takes air from atmosphere, compresses it and delivers the high pressure air to a storage vessel from which it may be conveyed by a pipe line to wherever the supply of air is required. 
    The high pressure air is having various chemical and industrial applications. It is used for operating the small pneumatic hand tools, such as riveters, drills, paint spraying, mining, tunneling operations etc., 
    Compression of gas in one stage suffers from many disadvantages like handling of very high pressures in one cylinder resulting leakage past the piston and ineffective cooling of the gas and also requires robust construction of the cylinder to withstand the delivery pressure. So multistage compression is very efficient. This multistage compression is universally adopted. The main advantages of multi stage air compression are reduction of driving power required, improved volumetric efficiency, high delivering pressure with less power, better mechanical balance and improved cooling during compression.
    The two stage air compressor consists of low pressure (L.P.) and high pressure cylinders (H.P.). The air compressed in the low pressure cylinder to an intermediate pressure which is between the intake and delivery pressure. The compressed air at higher temperature from the L.P. cylinder passes into an intercooler which is a heat exchanger. In the intercooler, the air gets an opportunity to cool down to the initial temperature by properly regulating supply of cooling water in the intercooler. The higher pressure cylinder is supplied from the intercooler and in the higher pressure (H.P.) cylinder; the air is compressed to the final delivery pressure and passed on to the storage pressure vessel or air receiver to be used when required.
</h3>          
<h2 class="h2"><u>PROCEDURE</u>:</h2>
<h3 class="t2">The pressure inside the air tank is first made atmospheric. This is done by opening 
the outlet valve of the air tank and letting the air to atmosphere. The readings 
that are obtained give the values above atmospheric and hence to be added with 
1.033 kgf/cm2.
Start the motor. Adjust the pressure to a particular value. Note the time taken
for five revolutions of the energy meter. Then calculate the input to the compressor
assuming a motor efficiency of 85%. Note the manometer reading and find the actual
quantity of air drawn into the compressor. The experiment in repeated for different pressures.</h3>
