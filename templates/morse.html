<h2 class="h2"><u>DESCRIPTION</u>:</h2>

The engine is a 4-stroke, 13 BHP water cooled vertical, four cylinders Ambassador Petrol Engine. 
The cylinders are arranged in-line. The engine is provided with a hydraulic dynamometer. 
The loading on the shaft takes place by allowing more water into the casing. Fuel is 
supplied from fuel tank through a three way valve. For obtaining fuel consumption, 
fuel will be drawn from burette provided, by cutting off the fuel from the fuel tank. 
Air is supplied throughout air filter and air tank. The quantity of air drawn into the 
cylinder may be measured by noting down the Manometric head from U-tube water manometer. 
Two dial gauges are provided on the panel to measure cooling water outlet temperature and 
the exhaust gas temperature near the engine. Four DPST switches are provided on the panel 
which are used to cut off ignition in any cylinder while conducting the Morse test. 
Ignition in any cylinder is indicated by the glowing of bulb which is connected to the 
LT side or from battery. Water supply is provided through a control valve for the cylinders.

<h2 class="h2"><u>PROCEDURE</u>:</h2>

Lubricating oil level, fuel level and water supply are checked. The engine is started with the help 
of ignition switch. Then the water supply for cooling of the engine is given. The speed is adjusted to 
1500 rpm using throttle. Some time is allowed for the engine to warm up and stabilize. For loading the 
engine the handle of the hydraulic dynamometer is rotated in the direction given on the handle as 'To open' 
this allows water to enter into the space between the impeller and the casing, thus loading the engine. With 
the help of the locking sleeve the handle is prevented from rotation. 
Now the engine is loaded approximately to half of the full load and the speed is adjusted to the rated speed 
(1500 rpm) using the throttle valve.  Let the load be W kgf. This throttle position is fixed for the remaining 
part of the experiment. The load W kgf. is noted.
Now, the ignition to the first cylinder is cut-off by opening the DPST switch corresponding to the cylinder-1. 
The speed  decreases to increase the speed to 1500 rpm by keeping the throttle position constant load is decreased. 
This load is noted down as W1 kgf. After noting down the load the ignition for cylinder-1 is restored by 
closing DPST switch for cylinder-1. Then the DPST switch for cyclider-2 is opened so that the ignition is 
cutoff. Once again the load is adjusted so as to run the engine at the rated speed 1500 rpm. Let the load 
be W2 kgf. Same procedure is repeated for cylinders 3 & 4. Respective loads W3 kgf. and W4 kgf. are noted 
down. Same experiment may be conducted for different throttle positions.  

<h2 class="h2"><u>CALCULATIONS</u>:</h2>

Maximum load calculation: 

	Brake Power = WN / 2717  = 9.568 kW

	where W in Kgf. read from the scale.

 Load on the engine when the ignition takes place in all the four cylinders = W kgf.
	
 Brake Power Developed =  WN /2717  kW = X  kW

Load on the engine when the ignition in the 1st cylinder is cut off =W1 kgf.

Brake Power developed =  W1*N /2717 KW = X1 KW

Indicated Power of the 1st cylinder - IP1 = (X-X1) kW =


Load on the engine when the ignition in the2nd cylinder is cut off =W2 kgf.

Brake Power developed =  W2*N /2717 KW = X2 KW

Indicated Power of the 2nd cylinder - IP2 = (X-X2) kW=


Load on the engine when the ignition in the3rd  cylinder is cut off =W3 kgf.

Brake Power developed =  W3*N /2717 KW = X3 KW

Indicated Power of the 3rd cylinder - IP3 = (X-X3) kW=

Load on the engine when the ignition in the4th cylinder is cut off =W4 kgf.

Brake Power developed =  W4*N /2717 KW = X4 KW

Indicated Power of the 4th cylinder - IP4 = (X-X4) kW=

Indicated power of the Engine IP = IP1 + IP2 + IP3 + IP4 

        IP = ______kW 
 

Î·<sub>mechanical</sub> = Brake Power / Indicated Power = X/IP

Frictional Power = Indicated Power - Brake Power.

                  FP=  ______ kW
